the typography that I am going to use is: Noto Serif Khojki
I create three different pages. Home: where we can find the question "What are you curious about?" and date box in case the user has the specific date of the event, afterwards it will take us to the information page(2) where we could find all the information about the image that the user wants to see. besides it there is a button, when the user clicks on the button; it would take us to the favourites page (3) where we can see all the information about the favourites images from the user.
